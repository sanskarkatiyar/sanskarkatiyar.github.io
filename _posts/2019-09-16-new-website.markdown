Hi there! Welcome to my new website! Having procrastinated on building a website for months, here it is. Turns out it wasn't _that_ difficult.

So, I recently started my graduate studies at University of Colorado, Boulder (CU). In my first semester I am taking Prof Heckman's Advanced Robotics course and Prof Larremore's Network Analysis and Modeling course.

More updates to follow.
